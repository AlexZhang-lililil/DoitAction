So be assertive:</p> <ul> <li>Look them in the eyes when you say 'no'</li> <li>Make your voice strong, clear and confident (but not aggressive)</li> <li>Stand or sit so you're looking down at them, not up. It makes you more powerful.</li> </ul> </div> </div>  <div class=\"collapsible-element closed\"> <h4>2. Make it a quick, clear 'no' <a href=\"#open\" class=\"collapse-trigger button button-mini\"><i class=\"icon icon-dropdown-open\"></i>&nbsp;More</a></h4> <div class=\"collapsible-content\"> <p>Don't hesitate, say that confident 'no' straight away. Actually use the word 'no', or 'no thanks'. You don't have to explain yourself to anyone, but if you want you can build on that 'no' with something like:</p> <blockquote class=\"speech-bubble\"><p>No, I'm taking it easy right now.</p></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"speech-bubble\"><p>No thanks. Did you hear? I quit.</p></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"speech-bubble\"><p>No, I'm not into it these days.</p></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"speech-bubble\"><p>No thanks, doctor's orders.</p></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"speech-bubble\"><p>No, I'm taking a break at the moment.</p></blockquote> </div> </div>  <div class=\"collapsible-element closed\"> <h4>3.

Hey, why don't we call Emma, see what she's up to?</p></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"speech-bubble\"><p>No, let's do something else. Wanna see a movie?</p></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"speech-bubble\"><p>No, I feel like a game of pool. You up for it?</p></blockquote> <p>Or whatever works for you and your group.

No.</p></blockquote> <p>And then, to take charge of the situation, change the subject.</p> <blockquote class=\"speech-bubble\"><p>Hey, have you seen that new game that's coming out?</p></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"speech-bubble\"><p>What did you think of that music video / sports game / movie?</p></blockquote> <p>Whatever makes sense for you and your group.

If they ask you why you're saying no, you don't have to defend yourself. Don't get into an argument about it - it's your decision and it stands.
